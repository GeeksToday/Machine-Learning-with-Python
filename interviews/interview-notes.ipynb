    "According to Agresti [1], “Categorical variables have two primary types of scales. Variables having categories without a natural ordering are called nominal. Example, mode of transportation to work (automobile, bicycle, bus, subway, walk). For nominal variables, the order of listing the categories is irrelevant. The statistical analysis does not depend on that ordering. Many categorical variables do have ordered categories. Such variables are called ordinal. Examples are size of automobile (subcompact, compact, midsize, large). Ordinal variables have ordered categories, but distances between categories are unknown. Although a person categorized as moderate is more liberal than a person categorized as conservative, no numerical value describes how much more liberal that person is. An interval variable is one that does have numerical distances between any two values.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“A variable’s measurement scale determines which statistical methods are appropriate. In the measurement hierarchy, interval variables are highest, ordinal variables are next, and nominal variables are lowest. Statistical methods for variables of one type can also be used with variables at higher levels but not at lower levels. For instance, statistical methods for nominal variables can be used with ordinal variables by ignoring the ordering of categories. Methods for ordinal variables cannot, however, be used with nominal variables, since their categories have no meaningful ordering.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nominal variables are qualitative, distinct categories differ in quality, not in quantity. Interval variables are quantitative, distinct levels have differing amounts of the characteristic of interest.”"

    "Skewness is asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or to the right. Skewness can be quantified to define the extent to which a distribution differs from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the graph appears as a classical, symmetrical \"bell-shaped curve.\" The mean, or average, and the mode, or maximum point on the curve, are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect normal distribution (green solid curve in the illustration below), the tails on either side of the curve are exact mirror images of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a distribution is skewed to the left (red dashed curve), the tail on the curve's left-hand side is longer than the tail on the right-hand side, and the mean is less than the mode. This situation is also called negative skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a distribution is skewed to the right (blue dotted curve), the tail on the curve's right-hand side is longer than the tail on the left-hand side, and the mean is greater than the mode. This situation is also called positive skewness.\n",
